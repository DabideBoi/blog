You know those "Top N websites that feels illegal to know" kind of videos? Well I feel tired of saving them and looking back at their videos just to check for that one website that me or my loved ones need. I also felt tired of trying to remember if these are really good websites or just a bunch of data collection medium that will suck all of my information.

So here is a list of websites, that I will probably update every once in a while, that I found on the internet.
