You know those "Top N websites that feels illegal to know" kind of videos? Well I feel tired of saving them and looking back at their videos just to check for that one website that me or my loved ones need. I also felt tired of trying to remember if these are really good websites or just a bunch of data collection medium that will suck all of my information.

So here is a list of websites, that I will probably update every once in a while, that I found on the internet.

1. [Tiny Wow](https://tinywow.com) [FREE, NO LOGIN]
    This websites provides a variety of tools for writing, image editing, and file manipulation. I haven't really used much of the tools it offers but for my use case I would say that it does its job without asking for my email or any contact information.
2. [Yarn](https://getyarn.io/) [FREE, NO LOGIN]
    If you are into making videos or you just love using movies as a "reference" then Yarn is the website for you. You can search for any line in a movie or TV show and Yarn will show you all the relevant results to your keywords. I personally use this to send funny gifs to my friends.
